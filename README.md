# Movie-Movie-Recommendation-System

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System repository! This project is an innovative journey into data science and machine learning, leveraging the power of Python to deliver personalized movie suggestions. Whether you're a movie buff or a data enthusiast, this system demonstrates the exciting fusion of data cleaning, natural language processing, and interactive visualizations.

ðŸ“š Project Overview
This project merges two critical datasetsâ€”movies and creditsâ€”to build a comprehensive data source for generating movie recommendations. By cleaning and preprocessing the data, and using advanced text processing techniques, the system accurately suggests movies based on the combined information from overviews, genres, cast, and crew.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
Python: The primary language used for scripting and building the recommendation engine.

Pandas & NumPy: For efficient data manipulation, cleaning, and numerical computations.

AST: To parse and handle JSON-like string data from our datasets.

NLTK (PorterStemmer): Utilized for stemming, reducing words to their root form to enhance text processing.

Scikit-Learn: Implements the TF-IDF Vectorizer and Cosine Similarity for robust recommendation logic.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating interactive visualizations that offer deeper insights into the data.

ðŸŒŸ Key Highlights
Data Integration & Cleaning:

Merged movies and credits datasets into one unified data source.

Handled missing values and removed unwanted characters.

Transformed JSON-like string columns into workable Python lists.

Advanced Text Processing:

Combined movie overviews, genres, cast, and crew into a unified "tags" column.

Applied TF-IDF vectorization for improved text representation.

Implemented stemming to standardize words and boost recommendation accuracy.

Recommendation Engine:

Leveraged cosine similarity to compute movie similarities in a high-dimensional space.

Developed a function to generate personalized recommendations quickly and effectively.

Interactive Visualizations:

Visualized genre distributions, tag length histograms, and cosine similarity scores.
